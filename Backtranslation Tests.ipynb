      "New Orleans, Louisiana, 1927. A group of enraged men descend upon the isolated Seven Doors Hotel, deep in the marshes. They catch an artist called Schweik (Antoine Saint John), who is cloistered there. Accusing him of being a warlock, Schweik is dragged into the cellar where he is savagely beaten with heavy chains, tortured with quicklime acid and crucified with his wrists nailed to a cellar wall, despite his terrible warnings of unleashing evil. Orleans, 1981. Liza Merril (Catriona MacColl) is a young woman who arrives from New York to claim the hotel as her inheritance. As soon as the architect friend Marin Avery (Michele Mirabella) starts showing him around the property, strange incidents begin to occur. A painter (Anthony Flees) falls off his platform and is horribly injured, coughing up blood and babbling on \"eyes, eyes\". Dr John McCabe (David Warbeck) arrives to take the injured man to the hospital and offers Liza his sympathy. Next, a plumber named Joe tries to fix a major leak in the flooded basement. However, he is assassinated by a presence that has emerged from behind a thin wall. The hotel's atmosphere is further cooled by the creepy-looking servants, Arthur (Giampaolo Saccarola) and Martha (Veronica Lazar), who apparently come with the hotel. Martha finds Joe's corpse in the basement and another much older corpse lying in a nearby pool of dirty water. It is apparently that of Schweik, the artist. Walking down the 14 mile causeway to New Orleans, Liza meets a strange blind woman standing in the middle of the desolate highway. The blind woman introduces herself as Emily (Sarah Keller) and tells Liza that she was waiting for her, although her eyes are blocked with cataracts. Liza leads Emily to her richly furnished house in New Orleans. Liza is warned by Emily to leave the hotel while she still can. Meanwhile in the hospital morgue, Dr John McCabe performs the autopsy of Joe the Plumber while his assistant Harris (Al Cliver) wants to install an EMG machine on Schweik's corpse. John laughs and leaves for lunch, while Harris stays to set up the EMG machine. After Harris leaves on a call, the EMG machine begins to vibrate with activity. A little later, Joe's wife, Mary-Anne (Laura De Marchi), arrives with her daughter Jill (Maria Pia Marsale) to dress her husband's corpse for the funeral, when she is killed in a wayhorrible by scalding with acid. Jill is then threatened by Schweik's resuscitated corpse. Liza meets John McCabe at a downtown bar to discuss her apprehensions and anxieties. He expresses bewilderment when Lisa complains about the ineptitude of her strange servants. John claims to have never heard of it before even though he knew everyone in the area. Then a phone call arrives from Harris who informs John that Mary-Anne's body has been found in the morgue, while Jill is found huddled in a corner frightened and unable to speak. After Joe and Mary-Anne's funeral, Emily appears to Liza again that evening at the hotel. Emily tells Liza about the warlock Schweik, who stayed in room 36 of the hotel, and the supernatural underworld the hotel hides. The hotel was built over one of the Seven Gates of Hell and Schweik was the keeper. Emily is about to reveal more when her hands wander over a canvas depicting a desolate vision of lost souls in a terrible, barren landscape. Suddenly scared, Emily says the picture was painted by Schweik before her death and that she runs out of the hotel lounge at night. But Liza notices a disturbing fact about her sudden departure: Emily didn't step on the bare wooden planks while she ran, neither did her guide dog.The next day, Liza nervously ventures into room 36, a dull fantasy of sheets - covered furniture and dusty skylights. She finds an old book, the strangely flesh cover of which bears the only word\n",

      "New Orleans, Louisiana, 1927. An enraged posse of men descend on the isolated Seven Doors Hotel deep in the swamps. They grab an artist called Schweik (Antoine Saint John), who is cloistered there. Accusing him of being a warlock, Schweik is dragged down to the cellar where he is savagely beaten with heavy chains, tortured with quicklime acid, and crucified with his wrists nailed to a cellar wall, despite his dire warnings of evil to be unleashed.New Orleans, 1981. Liza Merril (Catriona MacColl) is a young woman who arrives from New York City to claim the hotel as her inheritance. No sooner has architect friend Marin Avery (Michele Mirabella) begins to show her around the property, strange incidents begin to happen. A painter (Anthony Flees) falls off his rig and is horribly injured, coughing up blood and babbling about, \"the eyes, the eyes.\" Dr. John McCabe (David Warbeck) arrives to take the injured man to the hospital, and offers Liza some sympathy. Next, a plumber, named Joe, attempts to repair a major leak in the flooded cellar. However, he is murdered by a presence that emerged from behind a slim-caked wall. The atmosphere at the hotel is further chilled by the creepy-looking servants, Arthur (Giampaolo Saccarola) and Martha (Veronica Lazar), who apparently come with the hotel. Martha discovers Joe's dead body in the cellar, and another much older cadaver lying in a pool of dirty water nearby. It is apparently that of Schweik, the artist.Driving down the 14-mile causeway to New Orleans, Liza encounters a strange blind woman, standing in the middle of the desolate highway. The blind woman introduces herself as Emily (Sarah Keller), and tells Liza that she has been waiting for her, although her eyes are occluded with cataracts. Liza drives Emily over to her opulently furnished house in New Orleans. Liza is warned by Emily to leave the hotel while she still can. Meanwhile at the hospital morgue, Dr. John McCabe is performing the autopsy on Joe the plumber while his assistant Harris (Al Cliver) wants to install an EMG machine to the corpse of Schweik. John laughs it off and leaves for lunch, while Harris remains behind to install the EMG machine. After Harris leaves for a call, the EMG machine begins pulsing with activity. A little later, Joe's wife Mary-Anne (Laura De Marchi) arrives with her daughter Jill (Maria Pia Marsale) to dress up her husband's corpse for the funeral, when she is killed in a horrific way by scalded with acid. Jill is then menaced by the re-animated cadaver of Schweik.Liza meets with John McCabe in a downtown bar to discuss her misgivings and anxieties. He expresses puzzlement when Lisa complains about he ineptitude of her weird servants. John claims to have never heard of them before despite knowing everyone in the area. Then a phone call from the bar arrives from Harris who informs John that Mary-Anne's body was found in the morgue, while Jill was found huddled in a corner frightened and unable to speak. After Joe and Mary-Anne's funeral, Emily appears again to Liza that evening at the hotel. Emily tells Liza about the warlock Schweik, who stayed in Room 36 of the hotel and about the supernatural underworld that the hotel conceals. The hotel was built over one of the Seven Gates of Hell, and Schweik has been the Guardian. Emily is about to reveal more when her hands wander over to a canvas depicting a desolate vision of lost souls in a terrible and arid landscape. Suddenly afraid, Emily says that the painting was painted by Schweik before he died, and she runs out of the hotel parlor into the night.

      "New Orleans, Louisiana, 1927. An angry crowd descends deep in the swamps into the remote Seven Doors Hotel. They grab an artist named Schwejk (Antoine Saint John), who is imprisoned there. Accusing him of being a warlock, Schweik is dragged down to the cellar where he is savagely beaten with heavy chains, tortured with quicklime acid, and crucified with his wrists nailed to a cellar wall, despite his dire warnings of evil to be unleashed.New Orleans, 1981. Liza Merril (Catriona MacColl) is a young woman who arrives from New York City to claim the hotel as her inheritance. No sooner has architect friend Marin Avery (Michele Mirabella) started showing her the property than strange things happen. A painter (Anthony Flees) falls from his drilling rig and is seriously injured, coughs up blood and babbles: \"The eyes, the eyes.\" Dr. John McCabe (David Warbeck) arrives to take the injured man to the hospital, and offers Liza some sympathy. Next, a plumber named Joe tries to fix a major leak in the flooded basement. But he is murdered by a presence that emerges from behind a narrow wall. The atmosphere in the hotel is further cooled by the creepy-looking servants Arthur (Giampaolo Saccarola) and Martha (Veronica Lazar), who seem to be in the hotel with them. Martha discovers Joe's body in the basement, and another much older carcass lying nearby in a pool of dirty water. It seems to be that of the artist Schwejk. On the 14-mile-long embankment to New Orleans, Liza meets a strange blind woman standing in the middle of the desolate highway. The blind woman introduces herself as Emily (Sarah Keller) and tells Liza that she has been waiting for her, although her eyes are obscured by the cataract. Liza drives Emily to her opulently furnished New Orleans home. Liza is warned by Emily to leave the hotel while she can. Meanwhile, in the morgue of the hospital, Dr. John McCabe performs the autopsy of plumber Joe, while his assistant Harris (Al Cliver) wants to install an EMG machine on the body of Schwejk. John laughs it off and leaves for lunch, while Harris remains behind to install the EMG machine. After Harris leaves for a phone call, the EMG machine begins to pulsate. Shortly afterwards Joe's wife Mary-Anne (Laura De Marchi) arrives with their daughter Jill (Maria Pia Marsale) to dress her husband's body for the funeral when she is cruelly scalded with acid. Jill is then threatened by Schweik's reanimated corpse. Liza meets John McCabe in a downtown bar to discuss her concerns and fears. He expresses puzzlement when Lisa complains about he ineptitude of her weird servants. John claims to have never heard of them, although he knows everyone in the area. Then comes a call from Harris's bar informing John that Mary-Anne's body has been found in the morgue, while Jill cowers anxiously in a corner, unable to speak. After Joe and Mary-Anne's funeral, Emily returns to Liza's hotel that evening. Emily tells Liza about the warlock Schwejk, who stayed in room 36 of the hotel, and about the supernatural underworld that hides the hotel. The hotel was built over one of the seven gates of hell, and Schwejk was the guardian. Emily is about to reveal more than her hands wander onto a canvas depicting a bleak vision of lost souls in a terrible and barren landscape. Suddenly scared, Emily says that the picture was painted by Schwejk before he died, and she runs out of the hotel room into the night. But Liza notices a disturbing fact about her sudden departure: Emily has not stepped on the bare wooden boards while walking, nor has her seeing dog. The next day Liza nervously ventures into room 36, a dingy phantasm of furniture covered with sheets and shafts of dusty light. She finds an ancient book whose strangely meaty cover bears the only word\n",

The Killing Angel has no known accomplices or colleagues, is not affiliated with any government, religious, or criminal organization, and to this date their true identity has still remained secret. The Killing Angel is believed to be responsible for 6 murders in the past year alone, with only one thing connecting each of the assassinations - all the victims were criminals and deserved to die.Then the movie quickly moves on to the Killing Angel's most recent killing, the well-publicized assassination of a notorious ex-yakuza crime boss. Working swiftly, the Killing Angel is able to overcome the criminal's defense systems, quickly incapacitating the boss's bodyguards and isolating his target. In a fit of desperation, the crime boss promises to triple whatever fee the Killing Angel is being paid to kill him, then goes on to warn the vigilante that there is a massive revenge fund set to avenge his killing. Ignoring his pleas, the Killing Angel silently kills the crime boss.The scene then switches over to the story of Fu (Jet Li), a small-town gang member who lives an extremely simple and modest lifestyle, albeit being a contract killer. It is revealed that Fu is very kind and has trouble killing innocent people, a trait that causes him to be disliked by the other low-rent triad members. When Fu's boss reveals that there is now a $100 million US bounty on the Killing Angel's head for the slaying of the yakuza boss, Fu is quick to volunteer for the job, but is instead insulted.Fu then attempts to enter the building where the crime boss's lawyers are discussing the terms for the revenge fund, but is detained at the entrance and ushered out by security guards. In a surprisingly quick sequence, Fu defends himself by rapidly incapacitating each of the guards. His lightning-swift martial arts skills draw the attention of Ngok Lo, played by Eric Tsang, a seedy contract booker and loan shark, who comes to Fu's aid by pretending that he is an agent and Fu is his actor. Thanks to Lo's smooth talking, the pair is able to sidle into the meeting.The meeting however, comes to a halt when government agents, led by detective Chan (Simon Yam), raid the building in search of known criminals who are meeting there. Chan, a leading detective, has been working tirelessly to expose the Killing Angel's true identity for years.

When Lo asks for a demonstration of Fu's skills, he is able to rapidly take down several ruffians simultaneously, but falters when he is confronted by a woman.

      "The film begins with a brief reminder of the \"Killing Angel\", a dangerous assassin who operated in most of Southeast Asia. The Killing Angel has no known accomplices or colleagues, is not affiliated with any government, religious or criminal organization and to this day her true identity has remained a secret. It is believed that the Killing Angel was responsible for 6 murders in the past year alone, only one of which linked the attacks - all victims were criminals and deserved to be killed. Then the film quickly moves on to the most recent murder of the Killing Angel, the well-known murder of a notorious ex-Yakuza crime boss. Fast working, the Killing Angel can overcome the criminal's defense systems by quickly incapacitating the chief's bodyguards and isolating his target. In a fit of desperation, the crime boss promises to triple the fee the killing angel receives to kill him, then warns the vigilante that there is a massive revenge fund out there to avenge his killing. The Killing Angel ignores his pleas and silently kills the crime boss. The scene then switches to the story of Fu (Jet Li), a gang member from a small town who leads an extremely simple and humble lifestyle despite being a hit man. It turns out that Fu is very nice and has problems killing innocent people, a trait that results in his being disliked by the other members of the low rent triad. When Fu's boss reveals that the Killing Angel now has a $ 100 million bounty for killing the yakuza boss, Fu quickly volunteers for the job, but is instead insulted. Fu then tries to enter the building where the crime was committed. The chief's lawyers discuss the terms of the revenge fund, but are arrested at the entrance and taken out by security personnel. In a surprisingly quick sequence, Fu defends himself by quickly incapacitating each of the guards. His lightning-fast martial arts skills draw the attention of Ngok Lo, played by Eric Tsang, a seedy contract booker and loan shark who comes to the rescue of Fu by pretending to be an agent and Fu his actor. Thanks to Lo's smooth conversation, the couple can sneak into the meeting. The meeting is interrupted, however, when government agents, led by Detective Chan (Simon Yam), raid the building in search of known criminals who meet there. Chan, a senior detective, has worked tirelessly for years to uncover the real identity of the Killing Angel. The film then switches to a different sequence in which the character of Eiji Tsukamoto, the grandson of the murdered crime boss, played by Renji Sato, is introduced. Tsukamoto, tired of his grandfather's cowardice in life, now seeks his grandfather's power in death. Tsukamoto consumes some of his grandfather's cremated ashes, causing the late lord's supreme aid to think he is insane, but now all agents and gang members of the Tsukamoto family serve as their new master. Fu and Lo meet - Fu is a former mainland Chinese soldier who is part of a special, world-famous unit known as the \"Golden Soldiers.\" When Lo asks for a demonstration of Fu's skills, he can quickly defeat several rascals at the same time, but stalled when confronted with a woman. Lo then explains the deal with Fu, and they go to an amusement park to murder the first person believed to be the Killing Angel. When they get there, however, it is revealed that their target is a simple family man, and instead of killing him, Fu saves his life by killing his fellow assassins, the low-ranking triad members he used to live with.Fu and Lo are then arrested, but they are rescued by Lo's daughter Kiki (Gigi Leung), an intelligent and successful lawyer who is fed up with her father's scandalous ways and criminal connections.
