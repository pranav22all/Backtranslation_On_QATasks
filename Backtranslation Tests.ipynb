      "New Orleans, Louisiana, 1927. A group of enraged men descend upon the isolated Seven Doors Hotel at the bottom of the marshes. They catch an artist called Schweik (Antoine Saint John), who is cloistered there. Accusing him of being a sorcerer, Schweik is dragged into the cellar where he is savagely beaten with heavy chains, tortured with quicklime acid and crucified with his wrists nailed to a cellar wall, despite his terriblewarnings of the unleashing of evil, Orleans, 1981. Liza Merril (Catriona MacColl) is a young woman who arrives from New York to claim the hotel as her heirloom. Barely the architect friend Marin Avery (Michele Mirabella) begins to show him around the property, strange incidents begin to occur. A painter (Anthony Flees) falls off his platform and is horribly injured, coughing up blood and babbling \"eyes, eyes\". Dr John McCabe (David Warbeck) arrives to take the injured man to the hospital and offers Liza his sympathy. Next, a plumber, named Joe, tries to fix a major leak in the flooded basement. However, he is assassinated by a presence that has emerged from behind a thin wall. The hotel's atmosphere is further cooled by the creepy servants, Arthur (Giampaolo Saccarola) and Martha (Veronica Lazar), who apparently come with the hotel. Martha discovers Joe's corpse in the basement and another much older corpse lying in a nearby pool of dirty water. It is apparently that of Schweik, the artist.Walking down the 14 mile causeway to New Orleans, Liza meets a strange blind woman standing in the middle of the desolate road. The blind woman introduces herself as Emily (Sarah Keller) and tells Liza that she was waiting for her, although her eyes are blocked with cataracts. Liza drives Emily to her richly furnished house in New Orleans. Liza is warned by Emily to leave the hotel while she can. Meanwhile at the hospital morgue, Dr. John McCabe is performing the autopsy on Joe the plumber while his assistant Harris (Al Cliver) wants to install an EMG machine to the corpse of Schweik. John laughs and leaves for lunch, while Harris stays behind to set up the EMG machine. After Harris leaves for a call, the EMG machine begins pulsing with activity. A little later, Joe's wife, Mary-Anne (Laura De Marchi), arrives with her daughter Jill (Maria Pia Marsale) to dress her husband's corpse for the funeral, when she is killed in a wayhorrible by scalded with acid. Jill is then threatened by Schweik's resuscitated corpse. Liza meets John McCabe at a downtown bar to discuss her apprehensions and anxieties. He expresses bewilderment when Lisa complains about the ineptitude of her strange servants. John claims to have never heard of it before even though he knew everyone in the area. Then a phone call from the bar arrives from Harris who informs John that Mary-Anne's body has been found in the morgue, while Jill is found huddled in a corner frightened and unable to speak. After Joe and Mary-Anne's funeral, Emily appears to Liza again that evening at the hotel. Emily tells Liza about the warlock Schweik, who stayed in room 36 of the hotel, and the supernatural underworld the hotel hides. The hotel was built over one of the Seven Gates of Hell, and Schweik was the keeper. Emily is about to reveal more when her hands wander over a canvas depicting a desolate vision of souls lost in a terrible, barren landscape. Suddenly frightened, Emily says the picture was painted by Schweik before his death and that she is running out of the hotel lounge at night. But Liza notices a disturbing fact about her sudden departure: Emily didn't step on the bare wooden planks while she ran, nor did her guide dog.The next day, Liza nervously ventures intoroom 36, a drab fantasy of sheet-covered furniture and dusty skylights.
